Pre-Requisite
This plug-in node requires IBM Integration Bus (IIB) v9 or above, and has been developed on the IIBv9 FixPack 1 level of the product on both Microsoft Windows and Linux.

Installing the run-time component
After unzipping the plugin zip file, copy the runtime/ExceptionRuntime.jar file to all of the machines running brokers that are required to run the node. The JAR file should be placed in the <IIB Install Directory>/plugin location, where <IIB Install Directory> is the where the IIB runtime product was installed (for e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\MQSI\9.0.0.0\jplugin)

Installing the design-time component
After unzipping the plugin zip file, copy the toolkit/ ExceptionJavaPlugin.jar and place in the <IIB Toolkit Directory>/plugins location, where <IIB Toolkit Directory> is the where IIB Toolkit product was installed (for e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\IntegrationToolkit90\plugins)
